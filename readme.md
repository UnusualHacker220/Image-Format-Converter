# Image Format Converter (GUI)

This Python project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to convert image files between PNG and JPG formats using the `Tkinter` and `PIL` (Pillow) libraries.

## Features
- **Browse Images**: Allows users to select an image file from their system.
- **Convert PNG to JPG**: Converts PNG images to JPG format.
- **Convert JPG to PNG**: Converts JPG images to PNG format.
- **Error Handling**: Displays informative error and success messages using messageboxes.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

- **Tkinter**: The standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. (Usually installed by default with Python).
- **Pillow**: A powerful Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork.
- **Dictionary**: Using the dictionary allows us to dynamically call the appropriate conversion function based on the image format selected by the user.In our project, the dictionary data structure is used to map image formats.

### Install Pillow

You can install Pillow using `pip`. If it's not already installed, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: 

```bash
pip install Pillow
